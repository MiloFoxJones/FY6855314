        Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are being forced into the car market, to replace ICEs, to reduce 
        carbon emissions and combat global warming, with major government investments supporting their development as a 
        sustainable transportation solution. The UK government has introduced policies, including a ban on new petrol and 
        diesel vehicles by 2035 and incentives for BEV adoption. This atrticle will evaluate BEVs alongside other alternatives, 
        such as hydrogen and synthetic fuels, considering each option's potential to address environmental challenges and create 
        sustainable transportation for the future.

<h4 id="What are the key drawbacks of petrol, diesel and the internal combustion engine?">What are the key drawbacks of petrol, diesel and the internal combustion engine?</h4>
<p class="ex1">
    <pre>
        Transportation, including personal travel, goods transport, and vehicle use in agriculture and industry, is
        one of the largest contributors to global warming. In 2022, the UK’s transport sector accounted for 34% of
        domestic carbon dioxide emissions, with the majority from road transport emissions(2). However, emissions aren’t the only
        issue with internal combustion engines. Current ICE infrastructure is highly inefficient, as only 
        16–20% (3) of fuel in petrol engines is converted to movement, with the rest wasted as heat. Diesel engines are
        somewhat more efficient, converting around 24–28% (3) of fuel into motion, but have higher carbon footprints and
        release harmful particulate pollution, increasing cancer risks for those exposed.(4) So clearly there is a need
        for change, but what are the options?

<h4 id="The benefits of battery-powered electric vehicles">The benefits of battery-powered electric vehicles</h4>
<p class="ex1">
    <pre>
        Battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) have resurged as viable options for sustainable transport, largely due
        to advancements in lithium-ion technology, which is far more efficient than older lead-acid batteries.
        Today, BEVs are used for their zero tailpipe emissions, contributing to cleaner urban air and lessening the
        impact of transport on climate change. Unlike internal combustion engines (ICEs), BEVs are powered by electricity,
        which can increasingly be sourced from renewable energy, reducing emissions further (1). 
        
        BEVs also offer lower running costs: home charging costs significantly less than refueling with petrol or diesel,
        and BEV maintenance is simpler, thanks to fewer moving parts and regenerative braking systems. Even with concerns
        around battery life, advancements in battery technology are steadily improving vehicle range and efficiency (7).
        The anticipated solid-state batteries, expected to debut by 2026, promise lighter weight, faster charging, and 
        longer lifespan, making BEVs more practical and accessible (6).

<h4 id="The problems with battery-powered electric vehicles">The problems with battery-powered electric vehicles</h4>
<p class="ex1">
    <pre>
        Battery Efficiency:
        Electric motors are efficient, but their batteries lag behind. Tesla's top battery in 2023 had an energy density 
        of  272-296 Wh/kg (8), far less than petrol’s 13,100 Wh/kg (9), which is about 44 times higher! Since petrol is 
        far lighter and can be carried in smaller spaces, this makes petrol more suitable for applications like aviation 
        and shipping.

        Cost:
        The average purchase cost of a BEV is estimated to be around 35% higher than an equivalent ICE model (10). This is 
        because of the lack of economies of scale and the cost of battery materials.

        Convenience:
        You can fuel ICE vehicle in around 3-5 minutes, and that tank will give a range of between 350-500 miles. Refilling 
        a tank with hydrogen gas or eFuel takes around the same time as a petrol or diesel car and gives a similar range.
        However, even with Tesla’s superchargers it takes around 1hr (11) to fully recharge a BEV, which will give a 
        range of around 324 miles (12). If you don’t have driveway, you will have to park somewhere with a public charger 
        which may be miles from your home!
        
        Ethical Factors:
        Li-On batteries rely on materials like cobalt and nickel, often mined in unethical conditions in places like the 
        DRC. Efforts to reduce reliance on rare earth materials will take decades (13).
        
        Not as carbon-free as they seem:
        While BEVs emit no tailpipe emissions, their production and electricity use (mainly fossil-fueled) contribute 
        to carbon emissions. BEV manufacturing produces 70% more greenhouse gases than ICE cars, mostly due to battery 
        production (14).
        
        Slow Advances:
        Battery energy density improves at 5-8% annually (9). Solid-state and lithium-sulfur batteries promise progress,
        but widespread adoption is decades away. Current lithium-ion technology, developed over 30 years, remains dominant.

<h4 id="Zero-Carbon Alternatives to Electric Vehicles">Zero-Carbon Alternatives to Electric Vehicles</h4>
<p class="ex1">
    <pre>
        With 1.45 billion internal combustion engine vehicles in use globally in 2022 (15), alternatives to fossil 
        fuels are urgently needed.
        
        Biofuels:
        Biofuels, like bioethanol (from crops) and biodiesel (from waste fats) (16), offer renewable fuel options. However, 
        they are not truly zero-carbon, as production involves emissions and can harm forests by diverting land from food 
        production (1).
        
        Hydrogen Gas:
        Hydrogen is abundant and clean-burning, powering fuel cells with water vapor as the by-product (17). Despite 
        advantages like quick refueling and long range, production is costly and inefficient. Hydrogen also requires
        specialized infrastructure, with limited availability.
        
        E-Fuels:
        E-Fuels are synthetic hydrocarbons made by combining hydrogen with captured CO2. They can directly replace petrol 
        or diesel without modifying existing ICE vehicles (18). They are energy-dense and more efficient than hydrogen but
        costly to produce and still emit harmful gases (19).

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="ex1">
    <pre>
       When I started this article, I thought I already knew the answer to my question: battery EVs were an expensive and 
       poor solution to global warming. However, my research has changed my perspective.

       Today's batteries may perform poorly compared to petrol's convenience, but developments already underway will address
       issues like weight, range, cost, rare-earth reliance, and unsuitability for aviation and shipping.

       Long-term, BEVs powered by renewably-generated electricity will be the optimal solution for the environment. While
       necessary improvements might take over 50 years (9), BEVs will eventually match the convenience of fossil fuels far 
       more efficiently.

       BEVs, however, can’t immediately solve the challenge of 1.6bn ICE cars still on the roads (20) or storing the wasted 
       renewable electricity. I believe accelerating the development of synthetic liquid-hydrogen e-Fuel creates clean fuel that 
       can power the remaing ICE vehicles with no emissions and without modification, using existing infrastructure. 
       We need to carry on working on more efficient, light-weight batteries and technology that will make BEV's an all around 
       positive solution when our existing ICE vehicles die out.
