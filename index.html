        Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are central to efforts to reduce carbon emissions and combat global warming,
        with major government investments supporting their development as a sustainable transportation solution.
        Global warming, driven by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, has accelerated climate change,
        leading to rising sea levels, extreme weather, and other environmental threats. To cut transport emissions,
        the UK government has introduced policies, including a ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 and
        incentives for BEV adoption. This project will evaluate BEVs alongside other alternatives, such as hydrogen
        and synthetic fuels, considering each option's potential to address environmental challenges and create a 
        sustainable future.

<p class="ex1">
    <pre>
        Transportation, including personal travel, goods transport, and vehicle use in agriculture and industry, is
        one of the largest contributors to global warming. In 2022, the UK’s transport sector accounted for 34% of
        domestic carbon dioxide emissions, with the majority from road transport(3). However, emissions aren’t the only
        issue with internal combustion engines (ICEs). Current ICE infrastructure is highly inefficient, as only 
        16–20%(5) of fuel in petrol engines is converted to movement, with the rest wasted as heat. Diesel engines are
        somewhat more efficient, converting around 24–28%(5) of fuel into motion, but have higher carbon footprints and
        release harmful particulate pollution, increasing cancer risks for those exposed.(6) So clearly there is a need
        for change, but what are the options?

<p class="ex1">

        Battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) have resurged as viable options for sustainable transport, largely due
        to advancements in lithium-ion technology, which is far more efficient than older lead-acid batteries. This 
        modern battery tech brought the Tesla Roadster to market in 2003, showing that BEVs could combine performance
        with environmental benefits (7). Today, BEVs are preferred for their zero tailpipe emissions, contributing to 
        cleaner urban air and lessening the impact of transport on climate change. Unlike internal combustion engines 
        (ICEs), BEVs are powered by electricity, which can increasingly be sourced from renewable energy, reducing 
        emissions further (1). 
        
        BEVs also offer lower running costs: home charging costs significantly less than refueling with petrol or diesel,
        and BEV maintenance is simpler, thanks to fewer moving parts and regenerative braking systems. Even with concerns
        around battery life, advancements in battery technology are steadily improving vehicle range and efficiency (45).
        The anticipated solid-state batteries, expected to debut by 2026, promise lighter weight, faster charging, and 
        longer lifespan, making BEVs more practical and accessible (12). As battery technology continues to advance, BEVs
        are poised to become an even more efficient and sustainable choice for the future.
