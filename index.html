        Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are central to efforts to reduce carbon emissions and combat global warming,
        with major government investments supporting their development as a sustainable transportation solution.
        Global warming, driven by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from fossil fuels, has accelerated climate change,
        leading to rising sea levels, extreme weather, and other environmental threats. To cut transport emissions,
        the UK government has introduced policies, including a ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 and
        incentives for BEV adoption. This project will evaluate BEVs alongside other alternatives, such as hydrogen
        and synthetic fuels, considering each option's potential to address environmental challenges and create a 
        sustainable future.

<p class="ex1">
    <pre>
        Transportation, including personal travel, goods transport, and vehicle use in agriculture and industry, is
        one of the largest contributors to global warming. In 2022, the UK’s transport sector accounted for 34% of
        domestic carbon dioxide emissions, with the majority from road transport(3). However, emissions aren’t the only
        issue with internal combustion engines (ICEs). Current ICE infrastructure is highly inefficient, as only 
        16–20%(5) of fuel in petrol engines is converted to movement, with the rest wasted as heat. Diesel engines are
        somewhat more efficient, converting around 24–28%(5) of fuel into motion, but have higher carbon footprints and
        release harmful particulate pollution, increasing cancer risks for those exposed.(6) So clearly there is a need
        for change, but what are the options?

        Battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) have resurged as viable options for sustainable transport, largely due
        to advancements in lithium-ion technology, which is far more efficient than older lead-acid batteries. This 
        modern battery tech brought the Tesla Roadster to market in 2003, showing that BEVs could combine performance
        with environmental benefits (7). Today, BEVs are preferred for their zero tailpipe emissions, contributing to 
        cleaner urban air and lessening the impact of transport on climate change. Unlike internal combustion engines 
        (ICEs), BEVs are powered by electricity, which can increasingly be sourced from renewable energy, reducing 
        emissions further (1). 
        
        BEVs also offer lower running costs: home charging costs significantly less than refueling with petrol or diesel,
        and BEV maintenance is simpler, thanks to fewer moving parts and regenerative braking systems. Even with concerns
        around battery life, advancements in battery technology are steadily improving vehicle range and efficiency (45).
        The anticipated solid-state batteries, expected to debut by 2026, promise lighter weight, faster charging, and 
        longer lifespan, making BEVs more practical and accessible (12). As battery technology continues to advance, BEVs
        are poised to become an even more efficient and sustainable choice for the future.

<h4 id="The problems with battery-powered electric vehicles">The problems with battery-powered electric vehicles</h4>
<p class="ex1">
    <pre>
        Battery Efficiency:
        Electric motors are efficient, but their batteries lag behind. Tesla's top battery in 2023 had an energy density 
        of  272-296 Wh/kg (13), far less than petrol’s 13,100 Wh/kg (14), which is about 44 times higher! Since petrol is 
        far lighter and can be carried in smaller spaces, this makes petrol more suitable for applications like aviation 
        and shipping.

        Cost:
        The average purchase cost of a BEV is estimated to be around 35% higher than an equivalent ICE model (44). This is 
        because of the lack of economies of scale and the cost of battery materials.

        Convenience:
        You can fuel ICE vehicle in around 3-5 minutes, and that tank will give a range of between 350-500 miles. Refilling 
        a tank with hydrogen gas or eFuel takes around the same time as a petrol or diesel car and gives a similar range.
        However, even with Tesla’s superchargers it takes around 1hr (17) to fully recharge a BEV, which will give a
        ‘real world’ range of around 324 miles. (48) And while most journeys are well within the range of a single
        charge, many are not.
        You also need to carry a heavy cable in your boot, and you may need different cables for different
        chargers. And if you don’t have driveway those cables will have to be trailed across a pavement to your car.
        
        Ethical Factors:
        Li-On batteries rely on materials like cobalt and nickel, often mined in unethical conditions in places like the 
        DRC. Efforts to reduce reliance on rare earth materials will take decades (18).
        
        Not as carbon-free as they seem:
        While BEVs emit no tailpipe emissions, their production and electricity use (mainly fossil-fueled) contribute 
        to carbon emissions. BEV manufacturing produces 70% more greenhouse gases than ICE cars, mostly due to battery 
        production (19).
        
        Slow Advances:
        Battery energy density improves at 5-8% annually (14). Solid-state and lithium-sulfur batteries promise progress,
        but widespread adoption is decades away. Current lithium-ion technology, developed over 30 years, remains dominant.
        
        Industry Commitment:
        Most manufacturers, aside from companies like Toyota (12), are heavily invested in BEVs and are unlikely to pursue
        alternatives like hydrogen or eFuels. BEVs have a long development journey ahead compared to ICE vehicles’
        130-year head start.
